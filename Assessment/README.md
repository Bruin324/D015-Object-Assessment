## Scope, hoisting and compartmentalization

### Answer the following:
In you own words, explain the concepts of scope, hoisting, compartmentalization.

Scope is the bubble in which whatever variables, functions, objects you define will be respected/recognized.

Hoisting is the concept that declaring a variable, or defining a function will essentially be recognized as happening at the beginning of whatever scope you are currently in.

Compartmentalization is the concept of defining variable and functions within only the scope that they will be used, so that there will be no confusion with subsequent variable/function declaration.


### Provide examples for all three, below:

#### Scope: Global, Local

#### Hoisting: Variable Declaration

#### Compartmentalization: IIFEs
